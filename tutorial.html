		<h1>How to Make Pixel Art</h1>
		<h2>Important Tips</h2>
		<p>The truth about art is that some concepts are relevant to any art form and some are more specific. Knowing how to compose a piece of art, choose appropriate colors, represent everyday objects accurately; these skills are just as relevant in oil painting as they are in pixel art. However, pixel art does have its own little secrets that aren't found anywhere else.  </p>
		<h2>Anti-Aliasing</h2>
		<p>Anti-Aliasing is a trick for blending one color into another, typically to smooth a rough edge. Pixels are hard, angular shapes and sometimes aren't suitable for organic objects. In this case, pixel artists typically use an intermediate color sparingly along an edge like so:</p>

		<h2>Smooth Lines</h2>
		<p>This trick, like anti-aliasing, is used to smooth sharp, unnatural edges and is best explained visually.</p>

		<p>Notice how the line in the left image seems jagged and broken? This problem can be fixed either by altering the line, or, if that is not possible, adding anti-aliasing (AA) to the edges to smooth out the jagged edges.</p>
		<h2>Dithering</h2>
		<p>Dithering is a trick that has existed for a long time because it can be used to make 2 colors seem like 3 or more. This was especially useful when colors were restricted by technological limitations, but is still used to recreate the older style of pixel art and to replicate certain textures on a small scale (think chain mail or coarse sand). Dithering is often used sparingly, since it introduces visual interference and can add unwanted texture.</p>
